# HTML Semantic Elements

## 📘 Overview
Semantic elements in HTML clearly describe their meaning and purpose to both the browser and the developer. They improve code readability, accessibility, and search engine optimization (SEO).

## 🧩 What Are Semantic Elements?
Semantic elements tell **what the content is**, not just how it looks.  
Examples include headers, navigation menus, articles, and footers.

## 🧱 Common Semantic Elements

### `<header>`
Represents introductory content or a group of navigation links.

### `<nav>`
Defines a set of navigation links.

### `<main>`
Represents the main content of the document.  
There should be only one `<main>` element per page.

### `<section>`
Groups related content together within a document.

### `<article>`
Represents independent, self-contained content such as a blog post or news article.

### `<aside>`
Contains related or additional content, such as sidebars or notes.

### `<footer>`
Represents footer content such as copyright information or links.
